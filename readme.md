# Create your own web development portfolio landing page


## Description
We were tasked to make our own personal web-development portfolio using the skills we had gained in the first 2 weeks of the coding bootcamp.
It was important to make a starting portfolio so that we can use it moving forward to get jobs in the web-development field. Using the git commit function we can continue to add to our portfolio as we gain new skills. This is important as propsective employers will be able to see 
the new skills we have developed as we progess through the course and looked and how we have implemented these news skills into our portfolio.

While the project was difficult at first it was very important as i learnt a lot of new skills. The most important learning outcome i am taking away from this project is the importance of your html structure. It is important to keep on top of it and work in sections (plus  checking your work as you go). If you try to do too much html at once it is easy to get lost in your work, which can result in extra work and poor time managment. 
Furthermore, i was able to solve many problems by trial and error while doing this task, such as flex-boxes, media-queries, image sizing and keeping text within certain sections of the screen (just to name a few).

Overall, i did find the project difficult to begin with. But as i kept going and practiced my skills i felt more comfortable with the project. By the end of the project i am happy with my first ever attempt at creating a landing page from scracth. I  am looking forward to continuning to devlop and implement next skills that i can put into my portfolio.

## Usage

The first thing to i made sure i did was have the correct CSS file structure being rest.css followed by style.css 
This was important as html reads down. The html will read and apply all the css in the rest.css file then it was read all the stlyes in the style.css . 


The "nav-bar" class was added in with a href "#aboutme (for example) so that when you clicked on the About Me in the nav part you were direct to that section of the page. The same principle was applied to Aboutme, Mywork and Contact. 


The next section was my "About Me Section". I wanted it all to be in a flex-box so it could all fit to screen, i wanted my profile picture to flex as well as have a nice looking border that changed when hovered over. The text was all selected so it was easy to read. 


Part of the acceptance criteria was that the first image showcasing your work had to be bigger as well have the function to take you to its deployed page if selected. This was achieved by using appropritate css styles to make sure the image was big enough as well as having a href link to the deployed landing page of my first project; being 'Horiseon-Marketing-Mockup"


The contact me section was made up of way to contact me. Being email, facebook, linkedin and github. The email 'mjhwest89@gmail.com'
has a psedudo element so it stands out when hovered over. The facebook, linkedin and github logos were all provided with links to their respective pages. 


The contact me was a little  more interactive compared to previous sectoins. Mainly for styling reasons.  


Additional CSS elements were added through the project which can be located in the assets folder.
