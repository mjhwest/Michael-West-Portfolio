                    <br>
                    Thats me (over on the left)<br>
                    <br>
                    Welcome to my web-development portfolio. <br>
                    <br>
                    My name is Michael West and I am just starting out in the web-development world. <br>
                    But before we get into that here’s a little bit about me and how I ended up here.
                    I completed a psychology degree at UniSA, I then completed a masters degree in commerce marketing at
                    Adelaide University, after doing all that I decided to open a bar in Adelaide. I have been running
                    my bar for the past 6 years. <br>
                    <br>
                    Now im ready for my next chapter in life. <br>
                    To become a Full-Stack Developer! <br>
                    <br>
                    With my background in psychology, marketing and successfully running my own business I believe I
                    will have a fantastic array of skills to help clients develop and launch functioning webpages that
                    are tailored to their cliental. <br>
                    <br>
                    Im still in the early stages of full-stack development so be a little patient with me.
                    <br>
                    If you have any questions, please contact me via the ‘contact me’ section of the webpage! <br>
                    <br>
                    Cheers
                </p>
